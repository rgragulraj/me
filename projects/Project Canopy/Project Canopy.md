Node.js · AI/ML · Data Processing · Dashboard Development · Analytics · Retail Technology

## Abstract

Project Canopy is an AI-powered dashboard for small-scale retail shops. Retailers upload raw data, which Node.js services and AI models clean, organize, and aggregate into clear visual analytics. I built it as a side project to explore the developer side of AI and close a gap I saw in the retail tooling space.

## Content

### System Overview

**Pipeline:** Data Upload → AI Processing (Sorting & Cleaning) → Visual Analytics Dashboard → Business Insights

### Key Features

- **Automated Data Processing**: AI algorithms automatically sort and clean uploaded retail data
- **Visual Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard with visual representations of business metrics
- **Small-Scale Retail Focus**: Designed specifically for the needs of small retail shops
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive dashboard that doesn't require technical knowledge

### My Contribution

I developed this project independently as a side project to:
- Explore AI development from a developer perspective
- Address a gap I identified in the retail market
- Create a practical solution for small-scale retailers

The project involved building the entire stack using Node.js, from data ingestion and AI processing to visualization and analytics.

### What I Learned

### What I Learned

- **Node.js backend**: Built APIs, handled file uploads, and learned async/event-driven patterns.
- **AI for messy retail data**: Integrated models/APIs to clean, normalize, and structure inconsistent shop data.
- **Data pipelines & analytics**: Designed a simple pipeline from upload → processing → charts.
- **Product thinking**: Focused features on what small shop owners actually need instead of a generic dashboard.

This project helped me move from “AI concepts” to shipping a real tool that uses Node.js and AI to solve a concrete problem for small retailers.
