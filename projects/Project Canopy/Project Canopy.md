## Abstract

Project Canopy is an AI dashboard solution designed to address a gap in the retail market. Built as a side project to explore the developer side of AI, it provides small-scale retail shops with powerful data management and analytics capabilities.

The platform allows retailers to upload their data, which is then automatically sorted and cleaned using AI algorithms. Users receive comprehensive visual analytics to help them understand their business performance and make data-driven decisions.

The objective was to create a practical tool that leverages AI to simplify data management for small retailers while gaining hands-on experience with AI development.
