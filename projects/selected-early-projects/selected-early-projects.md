## Memory-Based STEM Game (EGR 201 – Team Project)

_2024_

Developed an interactive memory game for elementary students.

- **What it did**:
  - Custom game logic with multiple modes (memory + soundboard)
  - Designed to encourage cognitive engagement indoors
  - Focused on accessible, student-friendly hardware interaction

## Smart Mask Detection Gate (Competition Project)

_2023_

My first hardware–software integration project.

- **What it did**:
  - Implemented real-time face mask detection using OpenCV (Python)
  - Integrated with an Arduino-controlled gate prototype
  - Designed as part of a school robotics and computer science competition
- **What I learned**: This was my first experience connecting computer vision to physical actuation.

## Low-Cost Emergency Ventilator (COVID Response)

_2021_

Designed alongside an international championship team during COVID shortages.

- **What it did**:
  - Focused on low-cost, easily sourced components
  - Intended as a temporary emergency solution during ventilator shortages
  - Recognized by the Dean of Government Medical College, Coimbatore
- **What I learned**: This project introduced me to constraint-driven engineering and socially impactful design.

## Basic Garden Automation System

_2019_

Early summer project implementing:

- **What it did**:
  - Capacitive soil moisture sensing
  - Arduino-based solenoid valve control
  - Simple threshold-based watering logic
- **What I learned**: This project was an early precursor to my later embedded irrigation work.

## Cardiac Alert Watch (Google Science Fair Entry)

_2018_

Arduino-based wearable prototype with:

- **What it did**:
  - Heart rate sensor integration
  - GSM module for emergency alerts
  - Automatic SMS/call trigger on irregular readings
- **What I learned**: The prototype was early-stage and imperfect, but it marked my first attempt at real-time physiological monitoring and embedded communication.
